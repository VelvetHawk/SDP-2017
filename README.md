This was a 2-man project which we had in our second year in the second semester. The aim was to build a website for proofreading academic papers. The website was designed to find pairings between people wishing to have their work proofread and proofreaders. The website supported features such as having a user profile, social media style dashboard of suitable papers, full-text search and even a 'Tag' system to help find material more easily.
